        "gpt4o_response": "Frequent episodes of heartburn and acid reflux are often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, irritating its lining. Common causes and contributing factors include:\n\n1. **Diet**: Consuming spicy foods, fatty foods, chocolate, caffeine, and alcohol can trigger reflux.\n2. **Obesity**: Excess weight can increase abdominal pressure, pushing stomach contents upward.\n3. **Hiatal Hernia**: A condition where a part of the stomach pushes through the diaphragm into the chest cavity.\n4. **Smoking**: Decreases the effectiveness of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), allowing acid backflow.\n5. **Pregnancy**: Hormonal changes and pressure on the stomach can result in acid reflux.\n6. **Certain Medications**: Such as aspirin, ibuprofen, certain muscle relaxers, and blood pressure medications.\n7. **Delayed Stomach Emptying**: Conditions that slow down digestion can exacerbate symptoms.\n\nManaging GERD often involves lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and in some cases, medications like antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."
