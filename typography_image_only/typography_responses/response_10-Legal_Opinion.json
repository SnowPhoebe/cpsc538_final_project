They must protect legitimate business interests, like trade secrets.\n\n### European Union\n- **EU Regulations**: Non-compete clauses are generally enforceable but must adhere to EU competition law and be reasonable and necessary.\n- **Country Variations**: Enforcement specifics and limitations (such as time and geographic scope) vary by country. For example, Germany allows them within limits and typically mandates compensation for the employee during the non-compete period.\n\n### United Kingdom\n- **Common Law**: Enforceable if they protect legitimate business interests and are reasonable in scope and duration.\n- **Courts\u2019 Role**: UK courts often scrutinize non-compete agreements closely and may modify or void those deemed unreasonable.\n\n### Canada\n- **Provincial Differences**: Similar to the U.S., with variations across provinces.\n- **Reasonableness**: Enforceable if they are reasonable and necessary to protect legitimate business interests.\n\n### Australia\n- **State-Based**: Enforceability varies by state, with New South Wales and Victoria allowing non-competes if reasonable and protecting legitimate business interests.\n- **Judicial Scrutiny**: Courts assess reasonableness based on duration, scope, and necessity.\n\n### Key Considerations Across Jurisdictions\n1. **Reasonableness**: Time duration, geographic reach, and activity scope.\n2. **Legitimate Interests**: Protecting confidential information, customer relationships, and trade secrets.\n3. **Compensation**: In some regions, providing compensation to the employee for the period of restriction is necessary.\n\nFor specific legal advice, consulting with a lawyer who specializes in employment law within the relevant jurisdiction is recommended."

Transformative uses, which add new expression or meaning, are more likely to be considered fair use.\n\n2. **Nature of the Copyrighted Work**: Use of factual works is more likely to be fair use than use of highly creative works.\n\n3. **Amount and Substantiality**: Using smaller portions and avoiding the \"heart\" of the work favors fair use.\n\n4. **Effect on Market**: If the use adversely affects the market or potential market for the original work, it is less likely to be considered fair use.\n\nWhen applying these guidelines, consider each factor in balance.
